# zindi-regression-challenge
Sendy is a logistic company in Kenya. The aim of this project is to build a regression model for Sendy which can accurately predict delivery time, from the time a package is picked up to its arrival at the final destination.  To build this model, the Train dataset and the riders dataset will used. Regression models will be trained, and the most suitable will be selected. This model will then be used to predict delivery time for the test dataset author =Lereko Qholosha, email = lerekoqholosha9@gmail.com
